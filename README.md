# container_mongo

Container_Mongo is a project that sets up a Docker container running a MongoDB instance.  
It provides scripts to handle basic operations on the database, simulating an external client.  
These scripts enable making permanent changes to the instance data since using `docker exec <something>` would not persist changes.
